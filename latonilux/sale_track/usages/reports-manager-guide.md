# Quick Guide for Managers – SaleTrack Reports

This guide is for outlet and branch managers using the admin dashboards. It explains what to look at and when, without technical detail.

## 1. Daily Checks

- **Dashboard Overview (`/dashboard`)**
  - **Total Sales** – yesterday/today’s revenue for your branch (based on the date range at the top).
  - **Total Staffs** – total number of orders (how busy sales have been).
  - **Total Members** – total number of bookings (rooms/facilities).
  - **Chart** – trend of sales over the selected period; use it to spot slow or peak days.
  - **Action:** Each morning, set the range (e.g. last 7 days) and confirm the trend looks as expected.

## 2. Sales Reports

- **Sales Reports (`Reports → Sales`)**
  - Use this when you need more detail than the dashboard.
  - **Filters at the top:**
    - **Group By:** choose how to summarise – by **Day**, **Branch**, or **Resource**.
    - **Branch:** pick your branch; leave blank only if you are allowed to see all branches.
    - **Date Range:** always set a start and end date (e.g. this week, this month).
  - **KPIs:**
    - **Total Revenue** – money from all paid/completed orders and confirmed bookings.
    - **Total Orders** – number of orders + bookings.
    - **Total Quantity** – total items/units sold or booked.
  - **Export:** Use **Export Report** when finance or head office asks for a CSV file of sales for a period.

## 3. Inventory Health

- **Inventory Reports (`Reports → Inventory`)**
  - **Stock Summary:** shows how many units are in stock, low, or out of stock per branch.
    - Use this to identify items that need replenishment before they run out.
  - **Inventory Valuation:** shows the value of stock either by **Branch** or by **Item**.
    - Helpful for end-of-month stock valuation and discussions with finance.
  - **Lot Aging:** buckets lots by age (0–30, 31–60, 61–90, 90+ days).
    - Use this to watch for items approaching expiry or sitting too long on the shelf.

## 4. Allocation Controls

- **Allocation Reports (`Reports → Allocations`)**
  - Shows how much stock is **Reserved**, **Confirmed** (used), **Released**, and **Net Reserved** for each allocation.
  - Use this to:
    - Check departments that are using more or less than planned.
    - Spot allocations that should be released if not used.

## 5. When to Export

- Use **Export Report** buttons when:
  - You need to share numbers with finance or head office.
  - You want to analyse data further in Excel/Sheets.
- If you see a message like *“No data available to export for the selected filters”*:
  - Widen the date range, or
  - Check that the branch filter is correct.

If something looks off (e.g. no sales but you know there were orders), first check the filters (branch and dates). If it still looks wrong, escalate with a screenshot of the filters and page.
