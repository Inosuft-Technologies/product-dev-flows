# SaleTrack TODOs

- [ ] Surface recipe panels (read-only) inside Order Insights so supervisors can see the portions/components that drove each deduction.
- [ ] Implement deferred Menu Insights (recipe linkages, availability indicators) once allocation flows are stable.
- [x] Add unified `/v1/reports/sales` endpoint + frontend wiring (Sales vs COGS dashboards) as documented in `docs/plans/deffered-plan.md` (Section 6).
